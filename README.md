# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this repository was to design an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to predict classes of cryptocurrency. The analysis was completed using Python 3.7 in Juptyer Notebook with cryptocurrency data from CryptoCompare. The data included coin name information, total coins mined, total coin supply, algorithm, proof type, and trading status. The dataset was filtered to include only tradable cryptocurrency and crypto where coins have been mined. The number of dimensions was reduced to 3 using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group the data for the algorithm. A KMeans model was used for the machine learning algorithm, with the number of clustered determined to be K=4 based on the Elbow Curve. Finally, the results of this analysis contain the original dataset along with the predicted classification 0,1,2 or 3, PCA weighted components, and 2D and 3D scatter plots visualizing the grouped data.
